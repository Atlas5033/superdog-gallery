  <h1>About Superdog Smidge</h1>

  <p>Hi there! I'm an amateur programmer and creative experimenter who built Superdog Smidge to bring a little more laughter, imagination, and joy into the world — one dachshund comic at a time.</p>

  <p>This site runs on a combination of AI-generated art and storytelling prompts, stitched together with scripts and a lot of trial and error. Superdog Smidge is a superhero pup who reflects our moods, dreams, and occasional chaos — all while chasing tennis balls through space and time.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy these little adventures. They're here to make you smile — and maybe make the internet a slightly more delightful place.</p>
